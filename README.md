## About the course
Bootstrap is a popular framework designed for building responsive, accessible, and mobile-ready websites. An open-source platform using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery, it features a 12-column grid, icons you can incorporate into your designs, and fully functional JavaScript components that are ready to use.

This course provides everything you need to know to get started building websites with Bootstrap, and is built with our new practice environments in mind, which let you develop your code along with author Ray Villalobos. Ray will review Bootstrap's grid, CSS classes, and JavaScript components (dropdowns, modals, carousels, and more), and help you integrate them into your own sophisticated websites.

## Topics include:

- Understanding containers
- Using the 12-column grid to create a responsive webpage layout
- Creating rows and columns
- Styling content with Bootstrap CSS classes
- Adding CSS styles
- Creating and styling forms
- Creating dropdown menus and buttons
- Adding images and video
- Exploring JavaScript components, like carousels, tabs, tool tips, and scrolling
